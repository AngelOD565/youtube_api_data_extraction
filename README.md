# youtube_api_data_extraction

Data extraction using my favorite Youtube channel (Ivan Djuric). Extracted data using an API in Python with the requests library and transformed data into a Pandas dataframe for sentiment analysis. Statistics extracted from videos include view count, like count, and comment count. Other paramters extracted from the videos include the video title, video ID, and upload date.
